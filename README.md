A simple demo of a PDF diffing tool using [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) and [jsdiff](https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff)

## Installation

In the project directory, run:

### `npm i`

This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Running the project

In the project directory, run:
